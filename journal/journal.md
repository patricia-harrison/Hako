# 1701QCA Final project journal: *HAKO - Desk Companion*

<!--- As for other assessments, fill out the following journal sections with information relevant to your project. --->

<!--- Markdown reference: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ --->

## Related projects ##
<!--- Find about 6 related projects to the project you choose. A project might be related through  function, technology, materials, fabrication, concept, or code. Don't forget to place an image of the related project in the appropriate folder and insert the filename in the appropriate places below. Copy the markdown block of code below for each project you are showing. --->

<!--- Fill out name and link to related project in the code below. --->
[Arduino MP3 Player Project](https://educ8.tv/arduino-mp3-player/])

This project is related to mine as it is centered around the DFPlayer module. The related project is a tutorial which teaches the reader to create an MP3 player using an Arduino and the DFPlayer mini-module. In a brief description of the project, it is stated that that the tutorial is *heavily* reliant on the aformentioned module, which is the same with my HAKO project. 

Both of these projects provide the user with an interactive experience through pressing a button and playing one of however many tracks the DFPlayer has been provided. However, this tutorial uses three buttons; one to play and pause, one to play the next track and another to play the previous track, while I implemented a single button that will play a random track.

<!--- Fill out name and link to related project in the code below. --->
[Dice](https://microbit.org/projects/make-it-code-it/dice/)

This tutorial is related to mine through the use of the "pick random -- to --" maths code block which is provided in the makecode section on the Micro:bit website. The tutorial walks the reader through how to make their own responsive dice with the Miro:bit. When the micro:bit is shaken, it will trigger the code to randomly pick a number between 1 and 6. Once the number is picked, it wil be displayed on the inbuilt LED screen. My project follows a very similar concept. When button A is pressed, it will randomly pick an .mp3 file and play it while displaying a flashing heart.

<!--- Fill out name and link to related project in the code below. --->
[Name of related project](https://www.dfrobot.com/blog-1132.html)

This project is related to mine because it uses the DFPlayer mini module. The projects shows readers how to create a rotating christmas tree with LEDs and music. When button A is pressed, the LEDs light up, the DFPlayer module begins to play music and the 360 servo begins to spin clockwise. When AB is pressed, it cause the servo to spin anticlockwise and when button B is pressed, it turns everything off.

## Other research ##
<!--- Include here any other relevant research you have done. This might include identifying readings, tutorials, videos, technical documents, or other resources that have been helpful. For each particular source, add a comment or two about why it is relevant or what you have taken from it. You should include a reference or link to each of these resources. --->

## Conceptual development ##

### Design intent ###
<!--- Include your design intent here. It should be about a 10 word phrase/sentence. --->

### Design ideation ###
<!--- Document your ideation process. This will include the design concepts presented for assessment 2. You can copy and paste that information here. --->

### Final design concept ###
<!--- This should be a description of your concept including its context, motivation, or other relevant information you used to decide on this concept. --->

### Interaction flowchart ###
<!--- Include an interaction flowchart of the interaction process in your project. Make sure you think about all the stages of interaction step-by-step. Also make sure that you consider actions a user might take that aren't what you intend in an ideal use case. Insert an image of it below. It might just be a photo of a hand-drawn sketch, not a carefully drawn digital diagram. It just needs to be legible. --->

## Process documentation ##
<!--- In this section, include text and images (and potentially links to video) that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.

This should have quite a lot of information! It will likely include most of the process documentation from assessment 2 which can be copied and pasted here.

Use subheadings to structure this information. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for details of how to insert subheadings.

There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. --->

## Final code ##

<!--- Include here screenshots of the final code you used in the project if it is done with block coding. If you have used javascript, micropython, C, or other code, include it as text formatted as code using a series of three backticks ` before and after the code block. See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/ for more information about that formatting. --->

## Design process discussion ##
<!--- Discuss your process used in this project, particularly with reference to aspects of the Double Diamond design methodology or other relevant design process. --->


## Reflection ##

<!--- Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.

What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?

What parts of your project do you feel are novel? This is IMPORTANT to help justify a key component of the assessment rubric.

What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used? --->
